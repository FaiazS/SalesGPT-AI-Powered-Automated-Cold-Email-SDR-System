# SalesGPT-AI-Powered-Automated-Cold-Email-SDR-System
---
## ðŸ“Œ Overview

**SalesGPT** is an end-to-end AI-driven **Sales Development Representative (SDR)** that automates the generation, refinement, and delivery of cold outreach emails. It simulates a team of specialized AI agents working together to deliver high-converting emailsâ€”professionally, humorously, or conciselyâ€”before selecting the best one and emailing it with real-time formatting and subject-line optimization.

This project showcases the **multi-agent collaboration architecture**, **tool usage**, **guardrails**, and **prompt chaining** concepts to build intelligent, structured agent workflows.
